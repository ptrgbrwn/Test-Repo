All the rivers run into the sea;
yet the sea is not full;
unto the place from whence the rivers come,
thither they return again. 

    It is raining today
in the mountains. 

     It is a warm green rain
with love
in its pockets
for spring is here,
and does not dream
of death.	
                    	     
	Birds happen music
like clocks ticking heaves
in a land
where children love spiders,
and let them sleep
in their hair. 

     A slow rain sizzles
on the river
like a pan
full of frying flowers,
and with each drop
of rain
the ocean
begins again.
